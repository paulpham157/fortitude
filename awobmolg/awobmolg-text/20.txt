Albion Breakfast

	For Susan
	

Last night (here) a long pretty girl
asked me to write a poem about Albion,
so she could put it in a black folder
that has albion printed nicely
	in white on the cover.
	
I said yes. She's at the store now
getting something for breakfast.
I'll surprise her with this poem
	when she gets back.
