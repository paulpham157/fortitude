All Watched Over By Machines Of Loving Grace
----------------

I like to think (and
the sooner the better!)
of a cybernetic meadow
where manmals and computers
live together in mutually
programming harmony
like pure water
touching clear sky.

I like to think
	(right now, please.)
of a cybernetic forest
filled with pines and electronics
where deer stroll peacefully
past computers
as if they were flowers
with spinning blossoms.

I like to think
	(it has to be!)
of a cybernetic ecology
where we are free of our labors
and joined back to nature,
returned to our mammal
brothers and sisters,
and all watched over
by machines of loving grace.

-> The Beautiful Poem
----------------

I go to bed in Los Angeles thinking
	about you.

Pissing a few moments ago
I looked down at my penis
	affectionately.
	
Knowing it has been inside
you twice today makes me
	feel beautiful.

1. Get enough food to eat,
		and eat it.

2. Find a place to sleep where it is quiet,
		and sleep there.
		
3. Reduce intellectual and emotional noise
	until you arrive at the silence of yourself,
		and listen to it.
4.

-> November 3
----------------

I'm sitting in a cafe,
drinking a Coke.

A fly is sleeping
on a paper napkin.

I have to wake him up,
so I can wipe my glasses.

There's a pretty girl
I want to look at.

Flowers for those you love
----------------

Butcher, baker, candlestick maker,
anybody can get VD,
including those you love.

Please see a doctor
if you think you've got it.

You'll feel better afterwards
and so will those you love.

Comets
----------------

There are comets
that flash through
our mouths wearing
the grace
of oceans and galaxies.

		God knows,
		we try to do the best
		we can.

There are comets
connected to chemicals
that telescope
down our tongues
to burn out against
the air.

		I know
		we do.

There are comets
that laugh at us
from behind our teeth
wearing the ciothes
of fish and birds.

		We try.
		
Star Hole
----------------

I sit here 
on the perfect end
of a star,

watching light
pour itself toward
	me.

The light pours
itself through
a small hole
in the sky.

I'm not very happy,
but I can see
how things are
	faraway.
	
San Francisco
----------------
	This poem was found written on a paper bag
by Richard Brautigan in a laundromat in
San Francisco. The author is unknown.

By accident, you put 
Your money in my
Machine (#4)
By accident, I put
My money in another
Machine (#6)

On purpose, I put
Your clothes in the
Empty machine full
Of water and no
Clothes

It was lonely.

It's Raining in Love
----------------

I don't know what it is,
but I distrust myself
when I start to like a girl
	a lot.

It makes me nervous.
I don't say the right things
or perhaps I start
	to examine,
			evaluate,
				compute
	what I am saying.

If I say, "Do you think it's going to rain?"
and she says, "I don't know,"
I start thinking: Does she really like me?

In other words
I get a little creepy.

A friend of mine once said,
"It's twenty times better to be friends
	with someone
than it is to be in love with them."

I think he's right and besides,
it's raining somewhere, programming flowers
and keeping snails happy.
	That's all taken care of.
	
			BUT
if a girl likes me a lot
and starts getting real nervous
and suddenly begins asking me funny questions
and looks sad if I give the wrong answers
and she says things like,
"Do you think it's golng to rain?"
and I say, "It beats me,"
and she says, "Oh,"
and looks little sad
at the clear blue California sky,
I think: Thank God, it's you, baby, this time
	instead of me.
	
Hey! This Is What It's All About
----------------

		For Jeff Sheppard

No publication
No money
No star
No fuck
--------------

	A friend came over to the house
a few days ago and read one of my poems.
He came back today and asked to read the
same poem over again. After he finished
reading it, he said, "It makes me want
	to write poetry."

I Lie Here in a Strange Girl's Apartment
----------------

I lie here in a strange girl's apartment.
She has poison oak, a bad sunburn
	and is unhappy.
She moves about the place
like distant gestures of solemn glass.

She opens and closes things.
She turns the water on,
and she turns the water off.

All the sounds she makes are faraway.
They could be in a different city.
It is dusk and people are staring
out the windows of that city.
Their eyes are filled with the sounds
	of what she is doing.

December 30
----------------

At 1:03 in the morning a fart
smells like a marriage between
an avocado and a fish head.

I have to get out of bed
to write this down without
	my glasses on.

Our Beautiful West Coast Thing
----------------

					We are a coast people
There is nothing but ocean out beyond us.
		--Jack Spicer

I sit here dreaming
long thoughts of California

at the end of a November day
below a cloudy twilight
near the Pacific

listening to The Mamas and The Papas
	THEY'RE GREAT
	
singing a song about breaking
somebody's heart and digging it!

I think I'll get up
and dance around the room.

	Here I go!

Widow's Lament
----------------

It's not quite cold enough
to go borrow some firewood
from the neighbors.

Lovers
----------------

I changed her bedroom:
raised the ceiling four feet,
removed all of her things
(and the clutter of her life)
painted the walls white,
placed a fantastic calm
	in the room,
a silence that almost had a scent,
put her in a low brass bed
with white satin covers,
and I stood there in the doorway
watching her sleep, curled up,
with her face turned away
	from me.
	
Hollywood
----------------

	January 26, 1967
	at 3:15 in the afternoon

Sitting here in Los Angeles
parked on a rundown residential
	back street,
staring up at the word
	HOLLYWOOD
written on some lonely mountains,
I'm listening very carefully
to rock and roll radio
	(Lovin' Spoonful)
	(Jefferson Airplane)
while people are slowly
putting out their garbage cans.

Hey, Bacon!
----------------

The moon like:
mischievous bacon
crisps its desire

	(while)

I harbor myself
toward two eggs
over easy.

A Mid-February Sky Dance
----------------

Dance toward me, please, as
if you were a star
with light-years piled
on top of your hair,
	smiling,

and I will dance toward you
as if I were darkness
with bats piled like a hat
	on top of my head.
	
After Halloween Slump
----------------

My magic is down.
My spells mope around
the house like sick old dogs
with bloodshot eyes
watering cold wet noses.

My charms are in a pile
in the corner like the
dirty shirts of a summer fatman.

One of my potions died
last night in the pot.
It looks like a cracked
Egyptian tablecloth.

Albion Breakfast
----------------

	For Susan
	

Last night (here) a long pretty girl
asked me to write a poem about Albion,
so she could put it in a black folder
that has albion printed nicely
	in white on the cover.
	
I said yes. She's at the store now
getting something for breakfast.
I'll surprise her with this poem
	when she gets back.
	
It's Going Down
----------------

Magic is the color of the thing you wear
with a dragon for a button
and a lion for a lamp
with a carrot for a collar
and a salmon for a zipper.

			Hey! You're turning me on: baby
			That's the way it's going down.

						WOW!

Your Catfish Friend
----------------

If I were to live my life
in catfish forms
in scaffolds of skin and whiskers
at the bottom of a pond
and you were to come by
	one evening
when the moon was shining
own into my dark home
and stand there at the edge
	of my affection
and think, "It's beautiful
here by this pond. I wish
somebody loved me,"
I'd love you and be your catfish
friend and drive such lonely
thoughts from your mind
and suddenly you would be
	at peace
and ask yourself, "I wonder
if there are any catfish
in this pond? It seems like
a perfect place for them."

My Nose Is Growing Old
----------------

Yup.
A long lazy September look
in the mirror
says it's true:

I'm 31
and my nose is growing
	old.

It starts about 1/2
	an inch
below the bridge
and strolls geriatrically
	down
for another inch or so:
	stopping.

fortunately, the rest
of the nose is comparatively
	young.

I wonder if girls
will want me with an
	old nose.

I can hear them now
the heartless bitches!

"He's cute
		but his nose
is old."

At the California Institute of Technology
----------------

I don't care how God-damn smart
these guys are: I'm bored.

It's been raining like hell all day long
and there's nothing to do.

December 24
----------------

She's mending the rain with her hair.
She's turning the darkness on.
	Glue / switch!
That's all I have to report.

Nine Things
----------------

It's night

and a numbered beauty
lapses at the wind,

chortles with the
branches of a tree,

	giggles,
	
plays shadow dance
with a dead kite,

cajoles affection
from falling leaves,

and knows four
other things.

One is the color
of your hair.

Milk for the Duck
----------------

ZAP!
unlaid / 20 days

my sexual image
isn't worth a shit.

If I were dead
I couldn't attract
a female fly.

Let's Voyage into the New American House
----------------

There are doors
that want to be free
from their hinges to
fly with perfect clouds.

There are windows
that want to be
released from their
frames to run with
the deer through
back country meadows.

There are walls
that want to prowl
with the mountains
through the early
morning dusk.

There are floors
that want to digest
their furniture into
flowers and trees.

There are roofs
that want to travel
gracefully with
the stars through
circles of darkness.
