Our Beautiful West Coast Thing

					We are a coast people
There is nothing but ocean out beyond us.
		--Jack Spicer

I sit here dreaming
long thoughts of California

at the end of a November day
below a cloudy twilight
near the Pacific

listening to The Mamas and The Papas
	THEY'RE GREAT
	
singing a song about breaking
somebody's heart and digging it!

I think I'll get up
and dance around the room.

	Here I go!
