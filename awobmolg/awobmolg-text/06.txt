Comets

There are comets
that flash through
our mouths wearing
the grace
of oceans and galaxies.

		God knows,
		we try to do the best
		we can.

There are comets
connected to chemicals
that telescope
down our tongues
to burn out against
the air.

		I know
		we do.

There are comets
that laugh at us
from behind our teeth
wearing the ciothes
of fish and birds.

		We try.
