Hollywood

	January 26, 1967
	at 3:15 in the afternoon

Sitting here in Los Angeles
parked on a rundown residential
	back street,
staring up at the word
	HOLLYWOOD
written on some lonely mountains,
I'm listening very carefully
to rock and roll radio
	(Lovin' Spoonful)
	(Jefferson Airplane)
while people are slowly
putting out their garbage cans.
