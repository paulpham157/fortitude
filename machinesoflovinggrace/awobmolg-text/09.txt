It's Raining in Love

I don't know what it is,
but I distrust myself
when I start to like a girl
	a lot.

It makes me nervous.
I don't say the right things
or perhaps I start
	to examine,
			evaluate,
				compute
	what I am saying.

If I say, "Do you think it's going to rain?"
and she says, "I don't know,"
I start thinking: Does she really like me?

In other words
I get a little creepy.

A friend of mine once said,
"It's twenty times better to be friends
	with someone
than it is to be in love with them."

I think he's right and besides,
it's raining somewhere, programming flowers
and keeping snails happy.
	That's all taken care of.
	
			BUT
if a girl likes me a lot
and starts getting real nervous
and suddenly begins asking me funny questions
and looks sad if I give the wrong answers
and she says things like,
"Do you think it's golng to rain?"
and I say, "It beats me,"
and she says, "Oh,"
and looks little sad
at the clear blue California sky,
I think: Thank God, it's you, baby, this time
	instead of me.
