My Nose Is Growing Old

Yup.
A long lazy September 100k in the mirror says it's true:
I'm 31
and my nose is growing
old.
It starts about 1/2
an inch
below the bridge and strolls geriatrically
down
for another inch or so:
stopping.
cortunately, the rest of the nose is comparatively
youngãƒ»
I wonder if girls will want me with an old nose.
I can hear them now the heartless bitches!
"He's cute
but his nose
is old."
