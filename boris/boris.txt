My chances of being PM are about as good as the chances of finding Elvis on Mars, or my being reincarnated as an olive.
            -Boris Johnson

It is possible to have a pretty good life and career being a leech and a parasite in the media world, gadding about from TV studio to TV studio, writing inconsequential pieces and having a good time. But in the end you have a great sense of personal dissatisfaction.
            -Boris Johnson

There's an idea that London is a planet on its own: that it's starting to diverge from the rest of the solar system. We need to combat that.
            -Boris Johnson

I want to win and I want to be in office.
            -Boris Johnson

There is absolutely no one, apart from yourself, who can prevent you, in the middle of the night, from sneaking down to tidy up the edges of that hunk of cheese at the back of the fridge.
            -Boris Johnson

I am supporting David Cameron purely out of cynical self-interest.
            -Boris Johnson

It just happens I write fast and always have done.
            -Boris Johnson

I'm a one-nation Tory.
            -Boris Johnson

I'd like thousands of schools as good as the one I went to, Eton.
            -Boris Johnson

My policy on cake is pro having it and pro eating it.
            -Boris Johnson

My friends, as I have discovered myself, there are no disasters, only opportunities. And, indeed, opportunities for fresh disasters.
            -Boris Johnson

Voting Tory will cause your wife to have bigger breasts and increase your chances of owning a BMW M3.
            -Boris Johnson

What has the BBC come to? Toilets, that's what
            -Boris Johnson

I don't believe that is necessarily any more dangerous than the many other risky things that people do with their free hands while driving - nose-picking, reading the paper, studying the A-Z, beating the children, and so on.
            -Boris Johnson

I think I was once given cocaine but I sneezed so it didn't go up my nose. In fact, it may have been icing sugar.
            -Boris Johnson

Hillary Clinton has got dyed blonde hair and pouty lips, and a steely blue stare, like a sadistic nurse in a mental hospital.
            -Boris Johnson

The meat in the sausage has got to be Conservative.
            -Boris Johnson

If a constituent came to my MP’s surgery with her face obscured, I should feel fully entitled… to ask her to remove it so that I could talk to her properly. If a female student turned up at school or at a university lecture looking like a bank robber then ditto: those in authority should be allowed to converse openly with those that they are being asked to instruct.
            -Boris Johnson

I don’t know what a pint of milk costs. So what?
            -Boris Johnson

Why don’t you fuck off and die?
            -Boris Johnson

I’m down with the ethnics.
            -Boris Johnson

My chances of being PM are about as good as the chances of finding Elvis on Mars, or my being reincarnated as an olive.
            -Boris Johnson

The Lib Dems are not just empty. They are a void within a vacuum surrounded by a vast inanition.
            -Boris Johnson

Ping-pong was invented on the dining tables of England in the 19th century, and it was called Wiff-waff! And there, I think, you have the difference between us and the rest of the world. Other nations, the French, looked at a dining table and saw an opportunity to have dinner; we looked at it an saw an opportunity to play Wiff-waff.
            -Boris Johnson

I can hardly condemn UKIP as a bunch of boss-eyed, foam-flecked Euro hysterics, when I have been sometimes not far short of boss-eyed, foam-flecked hysteria myself.
            -Boris Johnson

He's a rather engaging geezer
            -Boris Johnson

I've slept with far fewer than 1,000
            -Boris Johnson

Exams work because they're scary
            -Boris Johnson

A horse is a safer bet than the trains
            -Boris Johnson

It is just flipping unbelievable. He is a mixture of Harry Houdini and a greased piglet. He is barely human in his elusiveness. Nailing Blair is like trying to pin jelly to a wall.
            -Boris Johnson

Never in my life did I think I would be congratulated by Mick Jagger for achieving anything.
            -Boris Johnson

I can’t sit down and negotiate with you on air when you’re holding a gun to Londoners’ head and threatening disruption to the greatest city on earth.
            -Boris Johnson

It is easy to make promises - it is hard work to keep them.
            -Boris Johnson

If gay marriage was OK ... then I saw no reason in principle why a union should not be consecrated between three men, as well as two men; or indeed three men and a dog.
            -Boris Johnson

The only reason I wouldn't go to some parts of New York is the real risk of meeting Donald Trump.
            -Boris Johnson

My ideal world is, we're there, we're in the EU, trying to make it better.
            -Boris Johnson

My speaking style was criticised by no less an authority than Arnold Schwarzenegger. It was a low moment, my friends, to have my rhetorical skills denounced by a monosyllabic Austrian cyborg.
            -Boris Johnson

I cant remember what my line on drugs is. Whats my line on drugs?
            -Boris Johnson

Dark forces dragged me away from the keyboard, swirling forces of irresistible intensity and power.
            -Boris Johnson

Yes, cannabis is dangerous, but no more than other perfectly legal drugs. It's time for a rethink, and the Tory party - the funkiest, most jiving party on Earth - is where it's happening.
            -Boris Johnson

I lead a life of blameless domesticity and always have done.
            -Boris Johnson

It is said that the Queen has come to love the Commonwealth, partly because it supplies her with regular cheering crowds of flag-waving picaninnies; and one can imagine that Blair, twice victor abroad but enmired at home, is similarly seduced by foreign politeness. They say he is shortly off to the Congo. No doubt the AK47s will fall silent, and the pangas will stop their hacking of human flesh, and the tribal warriors will all break out in Watermelon smiles to see the big white chief touch down in his big white British taxpayer-funded bird.
            -Boris Johnson

I don't believe that economic equality is possible; indeed some measure of inequality is essential for the spirit of envy and keeping up with the Joneses that is, like greed, a valuable spur to economic activity.
            -Boris Johnson

In 1904, 20 per cent of journeys were made by bicycle in London. I want to see a figure like that again. If you can't turn the clock back to 1904, what's the point of being a Conservative?
            -Boris Johnson

The difference between Hitler's speeches and Churchill's speeches was that Hitler made you think he could do anything; Churchill made you think you could do anything.
            -Boris Johnson

We should celebrate immigrants and everything they do for our country.
            -Boris Johnson

Remind me: who was the greater mass murderer, Stalin or Hitler? Well, Stalin is thought to have been responsible for about 50 million deaths, and Hitler for a mere 25 million. What Hitler did in his concentration camps was equalled if not exceeded in foulness by the Soviet gulags, forced starvation and pogroms. What makes the achievements of communist Russia so special and different, that you can simper around in a CCCP T-shirt, while anyone demented enough to wear anything commemorating the Third Reich would be speedily banged away under the 1986 Public Order Act?
            -Boris Johnson

On Donald Trump: “If he can fix North Korea and if he can fix the Iran nuclear deal then I don’t see why he is any less of a candidate for the Nobel peace prize than Barack Obama.”
            -Boris Johnson

On Nigel Farage: “He has always struck me as a rather engaging geezer.”
            -Boris Johnson

On Tony Blair: “He is a mixture of Harry Houdini and a greased piglet. He is barely human in his elusiveness.”
            -Boris Johnson

On Nick Clegg: “He’s a wobbling jelly of indecision and vacillation.”
            -Boris Johnson

On Hillary Clinton: “She has got dyed blond hair and pouty lips and a steely-blue stare, like a sadistic nurse in a mental hospital.”
            -Boris Johnson

Gandhi was wrong.
            -Boris Johnson

They voted for Tony, and yet they now get Gordon, and a transition about as democratically proper as the transition from Claudius to Nero. It is a scandal.
            -Boris Johnson

Will I throw my hat into the ring? It depends on what kind of ring it is and what kind of hat I have in my hand.
            -Boris Johnson

If the ball came loose from the back of the scrum, which it won’t of course, [becoming prime minister] would be a great, great thing to have a crack at.
            -Boris Johnson

I’m somewhere in the front forwards, and it’s a set-piece scrum, and we’re driving for the line, and the ball’s at our feet, and the enemy is wheeling – desperately, pathetically, breaking the rules of the game – and we’re going for a pushover try.”
            -Boris Johnson

I’m backing David Cameron’s campaign out of pure, cynical self-interest.
            -Boris Johnson

My ambition silicon chip has been programmed to try to scramble up this ladder, so I do feel a kind of sense that I have got to.
            -Boris Johnson

I could be president of the United States, technically speaking.
            -Boris Johnson

I have more in common with a three-toed sloth or a one-eyed pterodactyl or a Kalamata olive than I have with Winston Churchill.
            -Boris Johnson

We are already fulfilling our destiny as the soft power capital of the world, and that is thanks to [Margaret Thatcher], who knew all about soft power and the deep Freudian terror that every man has for the inner recesses of a handbag.
            -Boris Johnson

I know the London Labour left. I have studied them in their ways. I know their obsessions with strange far-left Latin American caudillos with proto-Marxist views and a curious hostility to free speech.
            -Boris Johnson

I am absolutely amazed to hear that the Liberal Democrats could take two positions at once on anything. It is quite an astonishing revelation.
            -Boris Johnson

I am a child of Europe. I am a liberal cosmopolitan and my family is a genetic UN peacekeeping force. I can read novels in French and I can sing the Ode to Joy in German.
            -Boris Johnson

Fifteen years ago the entire CBI, British industry, the City, everybody was prophesying that there would be gigantic mutant rats with gooseberry eyes swarming out of the gutters in the sewer to gnaw the last emaciated faces of the remaining British bankers because we didn’t go into the Euro.
            -Boris Johnson

I don’t see why people are so snooty about Channel 5. It has some respectable documentaries about the Second World War. It also devotes considerable airtime to investigations into lap dancing, and other related and vital subjects.
            -Boris Johnson

On Big Brother: “It’s become like cock-fighting: poor dumb brutes being set upon each other by conniving television producers."
            -Boris Johnson

Gangnam Style is very good. The prime minister and I danced gangnam style the other day, you will be shocked to discover.
            -Boris Johnson

On Banksy: “I think he’s a genius. He’s a great artist, and I like his stuff. But he’s got to accept it if, from time to time, someone will need to paint over his work.”
            -Boris Johnson

Did you see George Clooney and Sandra Bullock in that wonderful film Gravity, cowering as the interstellar projectiles whanged past them like a couple of pensioners sheltering from Ed Miliband’s new property taxes?
            -Boris Johnson

The greatest actor of this and possibly any epoch is the 49-year-old Hollywood veteran Nicolas Cage.
            -Boris Johnson

Five of the last six bestselling music albums were made in London, and we have exported Piers Morgan to America.
            -Boris Johnson

On the BBC: “Why on earth can it not produce something that is quite as brilliant as Breaking Bad?”
            -Boris Johnson

My faith is a bit like Magic FM in the Chilterns, in that the signal comes and goes.
            -Boris Johnson

I am very far from Zogist. Most of my ancestors come from Zog.
            -Boris Johnson

I challenged Boris Becker to a match once and he said he was up for it, but he never called back.
            -Boris Johnson

I did once build an Early Learning climbing frame. It took me about two days. It almost killed me in the end. And then my blimming children didn’t show the slightest interest in it.
            -Boris Johnson

I did briefly experiment with veganism. It didn’t last. I think it was the sheer cruelty of being deprived of cheese.
            -Boris Johnson

I cannot swear I have always observed the speed limit of 70mph.
            -Boris Johnson

I’ve got my fingers in several dykes.
            -Boris Johnson

I have not had an affair with Petronella. It is complete balderdash. It is an inverted pyramid of piffle. It is all completely untrue and ludicrous conjecture. I am amazed people can write this drivel.
            -Boris Johnson

On Liverpudlians: “They see themselves whenever possible as victims, and resent their victim status; yet at the same time they wallow in it.”
            -Boris Johnson

On Muslim women and burkas: “It is absolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letterboxes.”
            -Boris Johnson

On cannabis: “It was jolly nice. But apparently it is very different these days. Much stronger.”
            -Boris Johnson

To Ken Livingstone: “You are a fucking liar. You are a fucking liar. You are a fucking liar.”
            -Boris Johnson

To a London Assembly member: “Get stuffed.”
            -Boris Johnson

We in the Tory Party have become used to Papua New Guinea-style orgies of cannibalism and chief-killing.
            -Boris Johnson
