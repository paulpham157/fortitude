Raise boys and girls the same way.
%nBY YOUR RESPONSE TO DANGER IT IS
EASY TO TELL HOW YOU HAVE LIVED 
AND WHAT HAS BEEN DONE TO YOU.
YOU SHOW WHETHER YOU WANT TO STAY ALIVE,
WHETHER YOU THINK YOU DESERVE TO,
AND WHETHER YOU BELIEVE
IT'S ANY GOOD TO ACT.
%nExpiring for love is beautiful but stupid.
%nGoing with the flow is soothing but risky.
%nRuin your fucking self before they do. Otherwise they'll screw you because you're a nobody. They'll keep you alive but you'll have to crawl and say "thank-you" for every bone they throw. You might as well stay drunk or shoot junk and be a crazy fucker. If the rich guys want to play with you, make them get their hands dirty. Send them away gagging, or sobbing if they're soft-hearted. You'll be left alone if you're frightening, and dead you're free!
%nAlienation produces eccentrics or revolutionary.
%nSavor kindness because cruelty is always possible later.
%nIn a dream you saw a way to survive and you were full of joy.
%nSPIT ALL OVER SOMEONE WITH A MOUTHFUL OF MILK IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR PERSONALITY FAST.
%nIf you behaved nicely, the communists wouldn't exist.
%nTurn soft and lovely anytime you have the chance.
%nYou are a victim of the rules you live by.
%nBoredom makes you do crazy things.
%nYou confuse me with something that is in you. I will not predict how you want to use me.
%nDestroy superabundance. Starve the flesh, shave the hair, clarify the mind, define the will, restrain the senses, leave the family, flee the church, kill the vermin,vomit the heart, forget the dead. Limit time, forgo amusement, deny nature, reject acquaintances, discard objects, forget truths, dissect myth, stop motion, block impulse, choke sobs, swallow chatter. Scorn joy, scorn touch, scorn tragedy, scorn liberty, scorn constancy, scorn hope, scorn exaltation, scorn reproduction, scorn variety, scorn embellishment, scorn release, scorn rest, scorn sweetness, scorn light. It's a question of form as much as function. It is a matter of revulsion.
%nProtect me from what I want.
%nKnowing yourself lets you understand others.
%nA positive attitude means all the difference in the world.
%nAt times inactivity is preferable to mindless functioning.
%nExpressing anger is necessary.
%nSOME DAYS YOU WAKE AND
IMMEDIATELY START TO WORRY.
NOTHING IN PARTICULAR IS WRONG,
IT¹S JUST THE SUSPICION THAT
FORCES ARE ALIGNING QUIETLY
AND THERE WILL BE TROUBLE.
%nWith all the holes in you already there's no reason to define the outside environment as alien.
%nA sense of timing is the mark of a genius.
%nFood won't go down when you know your mother didn't want you, never liked to feed you, always hated you in her rooms. You were wrong to clutch and swallow and move your mouth. You must not be flushed, layered in fat or ripe from meat or she will despise your sight. Your skeleton cries, "I make no demands, I am ashamed of my needs, I am unworthy. I'm aware of those more deserving, those with prior and urgent claims to food." Skeleton says, "My safety is in slightness, my pride is denial. My victory is no gluttony, no guilt.
It is in your self-interest to find a way to be very tender.
%nBeing happy is more important than anything else.
%nFear is the greatest incapacitator.
%nTHERE IS A PERIOD WHEN IT IS CLEAR
THAT YOU HAVE GONE WRONG
BUT YOU CONTINUE.
SOMETIMES THERE IS A 
LUXURIOUS AMOUNT OF TIME 
BEFORE ANYTHING BAD HAPPENS.

%nI try to excite myself so I stay crazy.
%nBeing alone with yourself is increasingly unpopular.
%nYOU SHOULD LIMIT THE NUMBER OF TIMES
YOU ACT AGAINST YOUR NATURE,
LIKE SLEEPING WITH PEOPLE YOU HATE.
IT¹S INTERESTING TO TEST YOUR CAPABILITIES FOR A WHILE
BUT TOO MUCH WILL CAUSE DAMAGE.
%nHow do you resign yourself to something that will never be? You stop wanting just that thing. You go numb. Or you kill the agent of desire.
%nA lot of professionals are crackpots.
%nDeviants are sacrificed to increase group solidarity.
%nShe has no taste left to her and this makes it easier for me.
The color of her where she is inside is enough to make me kill her.
%nFEMALE VOICE: 'The truth is people are pushed around by two men who move all the bodies on earth into patterns that please them.'
MALE VOICE: 'I love my mind when it is fucking the cracks of events.'
MALE VOICE: 'What I give to all the people who do not want to live with me is arithmetic.'
FEMALE VOICE: 'Everyday, I do nothing important because I am scared blank and lazy. But then the men come. I put my mouth on them. I spit and write with the wet.'
MALE VOICE: 'I was not born live. This body grew but I did not feel cells split.
%nEnjoy yourself because you can't change anything anyway.
%nGo where people sleep and see if they are safe
%nWHAT A SHOCK WHEN THEY TELL YOU
IT WON'T HURT AND YOU ALMOST 
TURN INSIDE OUT WHEN THEY BEGIN.
%nIT CAN BE STARTLING TO
SEE SOMEONE'S BREATH,
LET ALONE THE BREATHING OF A CROWD.
YOU USUALLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT
PEOPLE EXTEND THAT FAR.
%nIdeals are replaced by conventional goals at a certain age.
