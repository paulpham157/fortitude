YOU DON'T HAVE THE OPTION OF CLOSING
YOUR EYES BECAUSE IT HAPPENS FAST
AND ENTERS YOUR MEMORY.
%
HAVING TWO OR THREE PEOPLE
IN LOVE WITH YOU
IS LIKE MONEY IN THE BANK.
%
THE SMALLEST THING CAN MAKE
SOMEBODY SEXUALLY UNAPPEALING.
A MISPLACED MOLE OR A
PARTICULAR HAIR PATTERN CAN DO IT.
THERE'S NO REASON FOR THIS,
BUT IT'S JUST AS WELL
%
YOU CAN WATCH PEOPLE ALIGN
THEMSELVES WHEN TROUBLE IS IN THE AIR.
SOME PREFER TO BE CLOSE TO THOSE AT
THE TOP AND OTHERS WANT TO BE
NEAR THOSE NEAR THE BOTTOM.
IT'S A QUESTION OF WHO
FRIGHTENS THEM MORE AND
WHOM THEY WANT TO BE LIKE.
%
IT'S NO FUN WATCHING PEOPLE WOUND
THEMSELVES SO THAT THEY CAN HOLE UP,
NURSE THEMSELFS BACK TO HEALTH,
AND REPEAT THE CYCLE.
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.
%
OBVIOSLY YOU STRIKE OUT
AGAINST PEOPLE WITHIN RANGE.
IT'S CATHARTIC TO AFFECT
SOMEONE WHEN YOU'RE ANGRY.
ALTERNATIVELY, CHOOSE
ENEMIES IMPOSSIBLY FAR AWAY
SO YOU NEVER HAVE TO FIGHT.
%
HANDS-ON SOCIALIZATION PROMOTES
HAPPY INTERPERSONAL RELATIONS.
THE DESIRE FOR AND THE DEPENDENCE
UPON FONDLING ENSURE REPEATED
ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN CARESSES AND
THE WILLINGNESS TO RECIPROCATE.
%
THE MOUTH IS INTERESTING BECAUSE
IT'S ONE OF THOSE PLACES
WHERE THE DRY OUTSIDE MOVES
TOWARD THE SLIPPERY INSIDE.
%
THE RICH KNIFING VICTIM CAN FLIP
AND FEEL LIKE THE AGGRESSOR
IF HE THINKS ABOUT PRIVILEGE.
HE ALSO CAN FIND THE CUT
SYMBOLIC OR PROPHETIC.
%
HOW DO YOU RESIGN YOURSELF TO
SOMETHING THAT WILL NEVER BE?
YOU STOP WANTING THAT THING,
YOU GO NUMB, OR YOU
KILL THE AGENT OF DESIRE.
%
I SAW THEM STRIP A MAN SO THAT
IN A MATTER OF SECONDS HE LAY
CURLED AND NAKED ON THE SIDEWALK.
%
IF YOUR CLOTHS CATCH FIRE,
DROP DOWN IMMEDIATELY,
ROLL UP IN A BLANKET, COAT, OR RUG
TO SMOTHER THE FLAMES,
REMOVE ALL SMOLDERING CLOTHING,
AND CALL A DOCTOR OR
AMBULANCE.
%
YOU HAVE TO MAKE THOUSANDS OF PRECISE
AND RAPID MOVEMENTS TO PREPARE A MEAL.
CHOPPING, STIRRING, AND TURNING PREDOMINATE.
AFTERWARDS, YOU STACK AND MAKE
CIRCULAR CLEANING AND RINSING MOTIONS.
SOME PEOPLE NEVER COOK
BECAUSE THEY DONT LIKE IT,
SOME NEVER COOK BECAUSE
THEY HAVE NOTHING TO EAT.
FOR SOME, COOKING IS A ROUTINE,
FOR OTHERS, AN ART.
%
IF YOU'RE SMART, YOU WATCH
FOR CHANGES IN COLOR.
THIS CAN APPLY TO SEEING THAT
FRUIT IS RIPE OR NOTICING THE FLUSH
THAT GOES WITH FEVER, DRUNKENNESS,
OR FURY.
%
WHEN YOU'RE ON THE VERGE
OF DETERMINING THAT
YOU DON'T LIKE SOMEONE,
IT'S AWFUL WHEN HE SMILES
AND HIS TEETH LOOK
ABSOLUTELY EVEN
AND FALSE.
%
IT CAN BE STARTLING TO
SEE SOMEONE'S BREATH,
LET ALONE THE BREATHING OF A CROWD.
YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT
PEOPLE EXTEND THAT FAR
%
IT IS HARD TO KNOW
WHAT SOMEONE WANTS BECAUSE
YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY FEEL HIS NEEDS.
YOU DEVELOP WAYS TO READ OR
ANTICIPATE DEMANDS OR YOU WAIT
UNTIL YOU'RE ASSAULTED AND
THEN HIS REQUIREMENTS
BECOME TANGIBLE.
%
YOU REALIZE THAT YOU'RE ALWAYS
SHEDDING PARTS OF THE BODY
AND LEAVING MOMENTOS EVERYWHERE.
%
AFFLUENT COLLEGE-BOUND STUDENTS
FACE THE REAL PROSPECT
OF DOWNWARD MOBILITY.
FEELINGS OF ENTITLEMENT CLASH WITH
THE AWARENESS OF IMMINENT SCARCITY.
THERE IS A RESENTMENT AT GROWING UP
AT THE END OF AN ERA OF PLENTY
COUPLED WITH REASSESSMENT OF
CONVENTIONAL MEASURES OF SUCCESS
%
WHEN ONE LEG IS SHORTER THAN THE OTHER
YOU KNOW THAT THE BODY WILL WARP AND
MANY PARTS WILL TWIST OUT OF ALLIGNMENT.
YOU CAN HOPE THE ADJUSTMENTS
WON'T BE CRIPPLING OR YOU CAN OPERATE
TO MAKE THE LEGS THE SAME.
%
IF SOMEONE IS WILD, PUNISHMENT WILL
LEAVE HIM SULLEN AND WILL ONLY
MAKE HIM WAIT FOR ANOTHER CHANCE.
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE IDEA THAT
UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR CAUSES PAIN AND
MUST, AT ALL COSTS, BE AVOIDED.
%
YOU SHOULD LIMIT THE NUMBER OF TIMES
YOU ACT AGAINST YOUR NATURE,
LIKE SLEEPING WITH PEOPLE YOU HATE.
IT'S INTERESTING TO TEST YOUR
CAPABILITIES FOR A WHILE
BUT TOO MUCH WILL CAUSE DAMAGE.
%
IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY FEELING
WHEN PART OF YOUR BODY ARE
TOUCHED FOR THE FIRST TIME.
I'M THINKING OF THE SENSATIONS
FROM SEX AND SURGERY.
%
WHEN SOMEONE IS BREATHING ON YOU,
YOU FEEL COOL AIR PULLED ACROSS YOUR SKIN
FOLLOWED BY MOIST WARM AIR PUSHED
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.
THIS OCCURS AT REGULAR INTERVALS
AND MAKES A PERFECT TEMPERATURE.
%
WINDOWS ARE A NICE FEATURE
BUT OFFER LITTLE SECURITY.
WHEN YOU STAND INSIDE AT NIGHT
YOU BECOME AWARE OF YOUR
HIGH VISIBILITY AND YOUR COMPLETE
BLINDNESS TO WHAT'S  OUTSIDE.
COURTESY OF THE BASIC DECENCY OF PEOPLE,
YOU'RE OFTEN LEFT IN PEACE
BEHIND THE GLASS.
%
MORE PEOPLE WILL BE BUILDING
HIDING PLACES IN THEIR HOMES,
SMALL REFUGES THAT ARE UNDETECTABLE
EXCEPT BY THE MOST SOPHISTICATED DEVICES.
%
AFTER DARK IT'S A RELIEF TO SEE A GIRL
WALKING TOWARD OR BEHIND YOU.
THEN YOU'RE MUCH LESS LIKELY
TO BE ASSAULTED.
%
YOU LEARN, THE HARD WAY,
TO KEEP A FINGER ON YOUR NIPPLE
WHEN  SHAVING YOUR BREAST.
%
YOUR BODY REFUSES TO OBEY
WHEN YOU'RE VERY SICK.
THE WORST IS WHEN YOU'RE ALERT
BUT INCAPABLE OF WILLING
YOURSELF ERECT.
%
IT'S AN ODD FEELING WHEN YOU
TRIGGER INSTINCTIVE BEHAVIOR,
LIKE NURSING, IN SOMEONE.
IT'S FUNNY TO BE IN HIS PRESENCE
WHILE A DIFFERENT PART OF
THE NERVOUS SYSTEM TAKES OVER
AND HIS EYES GET STRANGE.
%
BY YOUR RESPONSE TO DANGER IT IS
EASY TO TELL HOW YOU HAVE LIVED
AND WHAT HAS BEEN DONE TO YOU.
YOU SHOW WHETHER YOU WANT TO STAY ALIVE,
WHETHER YOU THINK YOU DESERVE TO
AND WHETHER YOU BELIEVE
IT'S ANY GOOD TO ACT.
%
EFFIGIES LET YOU STUDY OR ACT
UPON SOMEONE WITH IMPUNITY.
THEY ARE GOOD FOR PRACTICE.
%
A LITTLE GIRL HAD BEEN IN A COMA FOR WEEKS
BUT SMILED AND CAME OUT OF IT WHEN
HER FRIENDS SANG SONGS.
%
IT'S SCARY WHEN VEINS ARE
SO CLOSE TO THE SURFACE THAT
THEY'RE VISIBLE AND EVEN PROTUBERANT.
ACCESS IS EASY TO THE BLOOD THAT
TRANSPORTS THE NECESSARY CHEMICALS.
%
EVEN WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED
YOU CAN SEE SOMEONE APPROACHING.
HIS SHADOW SHOWS ON
THE INSIDE OF YOUR EYELIDS.
%
IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE WITH WHOM YOU'RE
INTIMATE AND UPON  WHOM YOU DEPEND.
FRIENDS WILL ONLY TOLERATE CERTAIN ACTIONS
AND THIS INFLUENCES WHAT YOU BELIEVE
TO BE POSSIBLE AND DESIRABLE.
%
GIFTED CHILDREN - THOSE WITH
AN IQ OF 125 OR ABOVE -
ARE PRONE TO FEELING OF ALIENATION,
FRUSTRATION, AND BOREDOM.
THESE FEELINGS CAN CULMINATE IN
VIOLENCE IF THE CHILDREN
ARE NOT ENCOURAGED AND CHALLENGED.
%
THERE IS A TERRIBLE PHASE WHEN
ABUSED ANIMALS OR CHILDREN ACT POLITELY
AND TRY TO DO EVERYTHING RIGHT.
BY THIS STAGE, THOUGH, THEY ARE SO
OBVIOUSLY WEAK AND UNAPPEALING
THAT THEY GET LITTLE RESPONSE.
IF THEY DON'T DIE THEY BECOME SAVAGE.
%
IT TAKES A WHILE BEFORE YOU CAN
STEP OVER THE INERT BODIES AND GO AHEAD
WITH WHAT YOU WERE TRYING TO DO.
%
IT'S A SAFE GAME TO PLAY
WITH YOUR NOSE, SHUTTING OFF THE AIR
AND LETTING IT FLOW AGAIN.
THEN YOU CAN ESCALATE AND SEE HOW
LONG YOU CAN LAST UNTIL YOU PASS OUT,
YOUR HAND RELAXES, AND
YOU BREATHE NORMALLY AGAIN.
%
IT'S EASY TO FEEL BETRAYED WHEN
YOU'RE JUST WAVING YOUR ARMS AROUND
AND THEY COME CRASHING DOWN ON
A SHARP OBJECT.
%
JUST ONE ROTTEN SPOT IN YOUR HEAD
CAN MAKE EVERY MOVEMENT PAINFUL.
YOU CAN'T ROLL YOUR EYES, BEND DOWN,
OR JUMP AND LAND WITH IMPUNITY.
EVEN THINKING HURTS.
%
LITTLE QUEENIE
ANY NUMBER OF ADOLESCENT GIRLS
LIE FACE DOWN ON THE BED AND
WORK ON ENERGY, HOUSING, LABOR,
JUSTICE, EDUCATION, TRANSPORTATION,
AGRICULTURE, AND BALANCE OF TRADE.
%
THERE IS A PERIOD WHEN IT IS CLEAR
THAT YOU HAVE GONE WRONG
BUT YOU CONTINUE.
SOMETIMES THERE IS A
LUXURIOUS AMOUNT OF TIME
BEFORE SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS.
%
MORE THAN ONCE I'VE AWAKENED WITH
TEARS RUNNING DOWN MY CHEEKS.
I HAVE HAD TO THINK WHETHER
I WAS CRYING OR WHETHER IT
IS INVOLUNTARY, LIKE DROOLING.
%
THERE IS PLEASURE IN STAYING HOME
TO ADJUST EACH PHYSICAL DETAIL SO THAT
WHEREVER THE EYE FALLS, THERE IS HARMONY.
THEN YOU GO OUTSIDE AND DO THE SAME.
%
SOME DAYS YOU WAKE AND
IMMEDIATELY START TO WORRY.
NOTHING IN PARTICULAR IS WRONG,
IT'S JUST THE SUSPICION THAT
FORCES ARE ALIGNING QUIETLY
AND THERE WILL BE TROUBLE.
%
SOMEONE WANTS TO CUT A HOLE IN YOU
AND FUCK YOU THROUGH IT, BUDDY.
%
IF THINGS WERE A LITTLE DIFFERENT
YOU WOULD DIGEST YOURSELF
THROUGH A CUT IN YOUR MOUTH.
IT'S A RELIEF TO KNOW THERE ARE
PROVISIONS AGAINST THIS.
%
THE FOND OLD COUPLE WAS
DISAPPEARING TOGETHER THROUGH
SUCCESSIVE AMPUTATIONS.
%
SOMETHING HAPPENS TO THE VOICES
OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE OUTSIDE.
THE SOUNDS ARE UNNATURALLY LOW
AND HOARSE AS IF THE COLD AND
DAMPNESS HAVE ENTERED THE THROAT.
%
THERE ARE PLACES THAT ARE SCARRED
AND THE SKIN IS PULLED AROUND,
LIKE THE NAVEL OR THE
HEAD OF THE PENIS,
THAT LEAVE YOU THINKING
THAT THE BODY IS FRAGILE.
%
IN A PARADISIAC CLIMATE EVERYTHING
IS CLEAR AND SIMPLE WHEN YOU ARE
PERFORMING BASIC ACTS
NECESSARY FOR SURVIVAL.
%
IT CAN BE HELPFUL TO THINK OF
THEM EATING YOUR FAVORITE FOODS
AND OCCASIONALLY THROWING UP
AND GETTING BITS STUCK
IN THEIR NOSES.
%
THERE'S NO REASON TO SLEEP
CURLED UP AND BENT.
IT'S NOT COMFORTABLE,
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR YOU, AND IT
DOESN'T PROTECT YOU FROM DANGER.
IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT AN ATTACK
YOU SHOULD STAY AWAKE
OR SLEEP LIGHTLY WITH
LIMBS UNFURLED FOR ACTION.
%
THERE'S THE SENSATION OF
A LOT OF FLESH WHEN EVERY
SINGLE HAIR STANDS UP.
THIS HAPPENS WHEN YOU
ARE COLD AND NAKED,
AROUSED, OR SIMPLY TERRIFIED.
%
MANY DOGS RUN WILD IN THE CITY.
SOME ARE ABANDONED BY THEIR OWNERS
AND OTHERS ARE BORN TO LOST DOGS.
STRAYS HAVE A LIMITED LIFE EXPECTANCY
EVEN WHEN THEY BAND TOGETHER IN PACKS.
THEY ARE PREY TO DISEASE, PARASITES,
WEATHER AND AUTOMOBILES.
THEY TEND TO BE FRIGHTENED AND VICIOUS.
THEY ARE UNABLE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES
OR ANYONE ELSE.
%
WITH SOPHISTICATED RECORD KEEPING
IT IS POSSIBLE TO PROVE THAT
YOU DID SOMETHING WRONG,
AND INCORRECT INFORMATION
CAN BE STORED AND SPREAD.
IN BOTH CASES YOU HAVE LESS OF A
CHANCE TO SAY THERE WAS A MISTAKE.
%
HOW DO YOU FIND THE RIGHT POSITION
TO LIE DOWN WITH PEOPLE
OR EVEN ANIMALS?
OFTEN ONE OF THE PARTNERS IS
SMOTHERED OR CONTORTED.
WHEN DONE PROPERLY, THOUGH,
EVERYONE IS HAPPY.
%
SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO NIBBLE ON
THE INSIDES OF THEIR OWN CHEEKS.
IV'E SEEN AN OTHERWISE LOVELY GIRL
CONTORT HER FACE TO REACH A FAVORITE SPOT.
THERE ARE BIT LINES WHERE REPEATED NIPS
HAVE BUILT RIDGES OF SCAR TISSUE.
%
TUNNELING IS GOOD FOR TRANSPORTATION,
CLANDESTINE MOVEMENT, AND THE DUAL
PROSPECT OF SAFETY AND SUFFOCATION.
%
USUALLY YOU COME AWAY WITH STUFF
ON YOU WHEN YOU'VE BEEN IN THEIR
THOUGHTS OR BODIES.
%
WHAT A SHOCK WHEN THEY TELL YOU
IT WON'T HURT AND YOU ALMOST
TURN INSIDE OUT WHEN THEY BEGIN.
%
WHEN YOU'VE BEEN SOMEPLACE FOR A WHILE
YOU ACQUIRE THE ABILITY
TO BE PRACTICALLY INVISIBLE.
THIS LETS YOU OPERATE WITH
A MINIMUM OF INTERFERENCE.
%
WITH BLEEDING INSIDE THE HEAD
THERE IS A METALLIC TASTE AT
THE BACK OF THE THROAT.
%
IF YOU WERE A GOOD CHILD
WITH FAIR PARENTS, YOU WOULD FREEZE IN YOUR TRACKS,
GO LIMP, AND TAKE A DESERVED BEATING.
A HOLDOVER FROM THIS MIGHT HAVE YOU
SUBMIT TO REAL DANGER,
BELIEVING THAT SOMEONE IS
APPORTIONING JUST PUNISHMENT AND
THINKING THEY WILL STOP SHORT OF KILLING YOU.
%
WITHOUT WARNING YOUNG ADULTS
CAN HEMORRHAGE AND DIE.
ANEURYSMS--WEAK BALLOON-LIKE
SECTIONS OF ARTERIES--ARE THE CAUSE.
IF THE BALLOON BREAKS,
UNCONTROLLABLE BLEEDING OCCURS.
A PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS
ANEURYSM IS FOUND IN THE HEAD.
%
YOU CAN MAKE YOURSELF ENTER
SOMEWHERE FRIGHTENING IF YOU
BELIEVE YOU'LL PROFIT FROM IT.
THE NATURAL RESPONCE IS TO
FLEE BUT YOU DON'T ACT
THAT WAY ANYMORE.
%
EXERCISE BREAKS AT STRATEGIC POINTS
DURING THE DAY ENHANCE PRODUCTIVITY
AND PROVIDE SIMULTANEOUS SENSATIONS
OF RELIEF AND REJUVENATION.
%
YOU CAN WASH YOUR FACE
UNTIL THE SKIN PULLS AND
ITS PRESSURE ON YOUR FACE IS
A CONSTANT REMINDER THAT YOU ARE ALIVE.
THIS IS A MILDER PRACTICE THAN
SMASHING YOUR HEAD AND CAN BE HELPFUL
IN THAT IT KEEPS YOU SENSITIVE.
%
IF YOU WISH TO LIVE ANONYMOUSLY,
SUCCESS IS CONTINGENT ON FORGOING
THE MANY BENEFITS ATTACHED TO
IDENTIFICATION, AND YOU MUST NEVER BE
SCRUTINIZED OR CAPTURED.
%
PEOPLE LIKE TO BREED ANIMALS.
DEVELOPING AND THEN REPLICATIONG NEW TRAITS
IS VERY PLEASING. THE FEAR AND THE ATTRACTION
IS THAT THE PROCESS IS
UNCONTROLLABLE.
